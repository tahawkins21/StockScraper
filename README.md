DOWNLOAD ALL FILES 
RUN THE .JAR
WHEN PROMPTED -- CHOOSE THE LOCATION OF THE DOWNLOADED SP500TICKER.CSV FILE
WHEN PROMPTED NEXT -- FOR THE OUTPUT CSV, CHANGE THE SP500TICKER.CSV TO ANOTHER NAME W/ .CSV EXTENSION. IT WILL CREATE THE FILE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY WITH THE NAME YOU GAVE
	E.G. -- SP500TICKERS.CSV -> NewOutPutFile.CSV

These two have to be done correctly for program to run.
